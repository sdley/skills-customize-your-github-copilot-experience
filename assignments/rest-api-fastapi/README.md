# 📘 Assignment: REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Build a RESTful API for a task management system using the FastAPI framework to learn modern web API development, HTTP methods, and JSON data handling.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create Task Management API

#### Description
Build a REST API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have an id, title, description, and completion status.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Implement a `GET /tasks` endpoint that returns all tasks as JSON
- Implement a `GET /tasks/{id}` endpoint that returns a single task by ID
- Implement a `POST /tasks` endpoint that creates a new task with title and description
- Implement a `PUT /tasks/{id}` endpoint that updates an existing task
- Implement a `DELETE /tasks/{id}` endpoint that removes a task
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, etc.)
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Store tasks in memory using a Python list or dictionary


### 🛠️	Add Filtering and Validation

#### Description
Enhance your API with query parameters for filtering tasks and add proper input validation to ensure data quality.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Add a `?completed=true/false` query parameter to `GET /tasks` to filter by completion status
- Validate that task titles are between 1 and 100 characters
- Validate that descriptions are optional but no longer than 500 characters
- Return meaningful error messages with 422 status code for validation failures
- Include API documentation at `/docs` endpoint (auto-generated by FastAPI)
